        "**Sentiment Analysis** is the task of determining the emotional tone behind a certain text. Sentiment can be classified as either *positive*, *negative* or *neutral* depending on the attitude expressed in the text. The following texts provide examples of positive, negative and neutral sentiment:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   \"This is beautiful! You really did a great job\" -- <font color='green'>Positive</font>\n",
        "*   \"Whaat? This is all wrong! I'm not happy with this at all\" -- <font color='red'>Negative</font>\n",
        "*   \"I guess it could be worse\" -- <font color='orange'>Neutral</font>\n",
        "*   \"Oh yeah, great job breaking my only laptop!\" -- <font color='red'>Negative</font>\n",
        "\n",

This will also give us a chance to familiarise with popular NLP techniques (such as **Regular Expressions** and **Context-free Grammars** as well as libraries that researchers in the field use to make their job easier (such as **NLTK** and **Scikit-Learn**).\n"

Grammars are designed to formalise the *syntax* of a language (i.e. how to write things that make sense in that language) and give no information on its *semantics* (i.e. what sentences in that language mean).\n",
